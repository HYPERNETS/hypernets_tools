# First line has to be as above, version number might change.
# Empty lines are ignored. 
# "#" is comment indicator. Every line (or part of it) that begins with "#" is
# ignored until newline character (\n) is reached.
# Only exceptions to above are:
#   - flag definitions with prepended "~ #";
#   - flag usage in geometry definition, where flag is considered
#     from "#" until closing geometry bracket "]"
# Comment lines are printed to system log during sequence execution.
# Use double comment "##" for suppressing the print.
# Whitespace characters (space, tab) are ignored, newline is used for end of
# valid line (including comment) detection

# Flag definitions:
~ #firstLessThanFourSec := $spectra_file1.it_vnir <= 4096
~ #sequenceWasFastEnough := $elapsed_time < 120

# Geometry is described in square brackets ("[]") prepended with an "@".
# Geometry format is as follows:
# @[ pan_angle, pan_reference, tilt_angle, tilt_reference ]
#   pan_angle and tilt_angle are in degrees
#   reference frame options:
#     "hyper" - the radiometer reference frame where the optical entrance of
#               the radiometer is pointing to nadir in the case of 0' tilt, 
#               to zenith in the case of 180' tilt, and to true north in the 
#               case of 0'/90' pan/tilt
#     "abs"   - the pan-tilt reference frame which is determined by the internal
#               position sensors of the pan-tilt unit
#     "sun"   - the solar reference frame which is relative to the current
#               position of the sun 

# 1. Irradiance Sky (Ed)
@[ 10.0, sun, 180.0, hyper ]

# Each geometry has a set of actions to be performed.
# Actions are prepended with a "+". Action format is as follows:
#   - for spectra scan:
#     "count.radiometer.entrance.exposure_time_vnir_ms.exposure_time_swir_ms"
#   - for images: "count.picture"
#   - for LED source measurement:
#   "count.validation.radiometer.entrance.exposure_time_vnir_ms.
#      exposure_time_swir_ms.vm_current_in_mA"
# radiometer options: 
#   VNIR = "vnir"
#   SWIR = "swir"
#   VNIR+SWIR = "both"
# optical entrance options:
#   RADIANCE = "rad"
#   IRRADIANCE = "irr"
#   DARK = "dark"
# 0 integration time setting will force instrument to find most suitable
# (highest peak value up to 80% of saturation) integration time automatically.
# 0 dark integration time setting will reuse the last radiance or irradiance
# measurement integration time.
# Integration time is ignored, if radiometer selection does not include given
# radiometer, e.g.
#   3.vnir.irr.0.128 will perform auto-adjustment, since vnir_exposure_time field is 0
#   3.swir.rad.128.0 will perform auto-adjustment, since swir_exposure_time field is 0
#   3.both.rad.0.1024 will perform auto-adjustment for VNIR, but use fixed 1024 for SWIR
# Validation current setting is limited both in driver and firmware to
# 2000 mA max for visible and 100 mA for SWIR.
# LED current setting is optional parameter and defaults to 1000 mA if omitted.
# Validation request with dark optical entrance will yield an error, since it
# does not make much sense.
# Note, that SWIR light is not implemented yet.
