HypernetsProtocol v2.1

# First line has to be as above, version number might change. Empty lines are ignored
# "#" Is comment indicator. Every line (or part of it) that begins with "#" is ignored until newline character (\n) is reached
# only exceptions to above are :
    # flag definitions with prepended "~ #";
    # and flag usage in geometry definition, where flag is considered from "#" until closing geometry bracket "]"
# Comment lines are printed to system log during sequence execution. Use double comment "##" for suppressing the print
# Whitespace characters (space, tab) are ignored, newline is used for end of valid line (including comment) detection

# Flag definitions :

~ #firstLessThanFourSec := $spectra_file1.it_vnir <= 4096
~ #sequenceWasFastEnough := $elapsed_time < 120


# Geometry is described in square brackets ("[]") prepended with an "@". Each geometry has a set of actions to be performed
# 1. Irradiance Sky (Ed)
@[ 10.0, sun, 180.0, hyper ]

# Actions are prepended with a "+". Action format is as follows:
# for spectra scan: "count.radiometer.entrance.exposure_time_vnir_ms.exposure_time_swir_ms"
# for images: count.picture
# for validation measurement: "count.validation.radiometer.entrance.exposure_time_vnir_ms.exposure_time_swir_ms.vm_current_in_mA"
# radiometer options: VIS_NIR = "vis, vnir", SWIR = "swi, swir", VNIR+SWIR = "bot, both"
# optical entrance options: RADIANCE = "rad", IRRADIANCE = "irr", DARK = "dark, dar, bla"
    # note, that there are forbidden configurations - both entrances can not be used at the same time
# 0 integration time setting will force instrument to find most suitable (highest peak value up to 80% of saturation) integration time automatically
# integration time is ignored, if radiometer selection does not include given radiometer. e.g.
    # 3.vnir.irr.0.128 will perform auto-adjustment, since vnir_exposure_time field is 0
    # 3.swir.rad.128.0 will perform auto-adjustment, since swir_exposure_time field is 0
    # 3.both.rad.0.1024 will perform auto adjustment for VIS_NIR, but use fixed 1024 for SWIR
# validation current setting is limited both in driver and firmware to 2000 mA max for visible and 100mA for SWIR.
# validation current setting is optional parameter and defaults to 1000 mA if omitted
# validation request with dark optical entrance will yield an error, since it does not make much sense
# Note, that SWIR light is not implemented yet
